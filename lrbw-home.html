Commas,
Revision:

Commas are a common form of punctuation taught to students and are therefore expected to be used routinely. They act as the 'amber' in the traffic light system; they tell us to take a brief pause when reading - not as long as a full stop.
Commas are used to indicate natural pauses, to add extra information to a sentence, and to separate items in a list.

Examples:
